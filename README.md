# Voice-Controlled-Obstacle-Avoiding-Car

Obstacle avoiding robot that bears a near resemblance to Disney-Pixar's Wall-E robot (primarily due to the HCSR04 ultrasonic sensor on the front!)

Responds to voice commands relayed over Bluetooth from an Android smartphone for the bot to go F,B,L,R and perform obstacle avoidance. When the bot encounters an obstacle, it shakes its head a.k.a the HCSR04 sensor (mounted on an SG90 mini servo) left to right as a way of saying 'No, not going there!'.  

Made as a part of the display for the Inter-Club Expo '17 at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, India.
